	abstract = {ABSTRACTDeployment of larger scale wind turbine systems, particularly offshore, requires more organized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Among existing maintenance strategies, reliability centred maintenance is regarded as best for offshore wind turbines, delivering corrective and proactive (i.e. preventive and predictive) maintenance techniques enabling wind turbines to achieve high availability and low cost of energy. Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and present the wind industry with a detailed analysis of the current practical challenges with existing wind turbine condition monitoring technology.

@article{CMS_Costs,
	abstract = {Wind turbines are being increasingly deployed in remote onshore and offshore areas due to the richer wind resource there and the advantages of mitigating the land use and visual impact issues. However, site accessing difficulties and the shortage of proper transportation and installation vehicles/vessels are challenging the operation and maintenance of the giants erected at these remote sites. In addition to the continual pressure on lowering the cost of energy of wind, condition monitoring is being regarded as one of the best solutions for the maintenance issues and therefore is attracting significant interest today. Much effort has been made in developing wind turbine condition monitoring systems and inventing dedicated condition monitoring technologies. However, the high cost and the various capability limitations of available achievements have delayed their extensive use. A cost-effective and reliable wind turbine condition monitoring technique is still sought for today. The purpose of this paper is to develop such a technique through interpreting the SCADA data collected from wind turbines, which have already been collected but have long been ignored due to lack of appropriate data interpretation tools. The major contributions of this paper include: (1) develop an effective method for processing raw SCADA data; (2) propose an alternative condition monitoring technique based on investigating the correlations among relevant SCADA data; and (3) realise the quantitative assessment of the health condition of a turbine under varying operational conditions. Both laboratory and site verification tests have been conducted. It has been shown that the proposed technique not only has a potential powerful capability in detecting incipient wind turbine blade and drive train faults, but also exhibits an amazing ability in tracing their further deterioration.},

@inproceedings{sequence,
	abstract = {Pattern mining is a branch of data mining used to discover hidden patterns or correlations among data. We use rare sequential pattern mining to find anomalies in critical infrastructure control networks such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks. As anomalous events occur rarely in a system and SCADA systems' topology and actions do not change often, we argue that some anomalies can be detected using rare sequential pattern mining. This anomaly detection would be useful for intrusion detection or erroneous behaviour of a system. Although research into rare itemsets mining previously exists, neither research into rare sequential pattern mining nor its applicability to SCADA system anomaly detection has previously been completed. Moreover, since there is no consideration to events order, the applicability to intrusion detection in SCADA is minimal. By ensuring the events' order is maintained, in this paper, we propose a novel Rare Sequential Pattern Mining (RSPM) technique which is a useful anomaly detection system for SCADA. We compared our algorithm with a rare itemset mining algorithm and found anomalous events in SCADA logs.},

@article{Log_label,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT Previous research for detecting incipient wind turbine failures, using condition monitoring algorithms, concentrated on wind turbine Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) signals, such as power output, wind speed and bearing temperatures, using power-curve and temperature relationships. However, very little research effort has been made on wind turbine SCADA alarms. When wind turbines are operating in significantly sized wind farms, these alarm triggers are overwhelming for operators or maintainers alike because of large number occurring in a 10 min SCADA period. This paper considers these alarms originating in two large populations of modern onshore wind turbines over a period of 1--2 years. First, an analysis is made on where the alarms originate. Second, a methodology for prioritizing the alarms is adopted from an oil and gas industry standard to show the seriousness of the alarm data volume. Third, two methods of alarm analysis, time-sequence and probability-based, are proposed and demonstrated on the data from one of the wind turbine populations, considering pitch and converter systems with known faults. The results of this work show that alarm data require relatively little storage yet provide rich condition monitoring information. Both the time-sequence and probability-based analysis methods have the potential to rationalize and reduce alarm data, providing valuable fault detection, diagnosis and prognosis from the conditions under which the alarms are generated. These methods should be developed and integrated into an intelligent alarm handling system for wind farms, aimed at improving wind turbine reliability to reduce downtime, increase availability and leading to a well-organized maintenance schedule.

@article{Schlechtingen,
	abstract = {This paper presents the research results of a comparison of three different model based approaches for wind turbine fault detection in online SCADA data, by applying developed models to five real measured faults and anomalies. The regression based model as the simplest approach to build a normal behavior model is compared to two artificial neural network based approaches, which are a full signal reconstruction and an autoregressive normal behavior model. Based on a real time series containing two generator bearing damages the capabilities of identifying the incipient fault prior to the actual failure are investigated. The period after the first bearing damage is used to develop the three normal behavior models. The developed or trained models are used to investigate how the second damage manifests in the prediction error. Furthermore the full signal reconstruction and the autoregressive approach are applied to further real time series containing gearbox bearing damages and stator temperature anomalies. The comparison revealed all three models being capable of detecting incipient faults. However, they differ in the effort required for model development and the remaining operational time after first indication of damage. The general nonlinear neural network approaches outperform the regression model. The remaining seasonality in the regression model prediction error makes it difficult to detect abnormality and leads to increased alarm levels and thus a shorter remaining operational period. For the bearing damages and the stator anomalies under investigation the full signal reconstruction neural network gave the best fault visibility and thus led to the highest confidence level.},
