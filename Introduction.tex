\section{Background}
In 2020, renewable energy represented 22.1\% of energy consumed in the EU \cite{Renewable_energy_statistics}. This
percentage is expected to increase drastically in the upcoming years with the target, set by
the European Commission, of at least 32\% by the year 2030 \cite{Renewable_energy_targets}. With the increasing number
of renewable energy assets being deployed every year, automated condition monitoring
solutions are needed for operators to be able to scale up. This need gets more relevant in the
case of operating offshore wind farms, where the cost of maintenance relative to the levelized
cost of energy (LCOE) is significantly higher compared with onshore \cite{SCADA_NBM_Review}.
Several approaches for condition monitoring were developed in the recent years that use
SCADA1 data given its low cost (normally requiring no additional sensors).
One of the methods used for condition monitoring using SCADA data is Normal Behavior
Modelling (NBM). NBM uses the idea of detecting anomalies from normal operation by
empirically modelling a measured parameter, used to reflect the condition of a specific part of
the turbine, based on a training phase (usually during a healthy state of the turbine). During
operation, the difference between the measured and the modelled/predicted signal is used as
indicator for a possible fault. A difference of 0, with some tolerance, reflects normal conditions,
whereas a difference greater or less than 0 reflects changed conditions or failures \cite{SCADA_NBM_Review}.

\section{Motivation}
While NBMs using SCADA data were proven capable of predicting failures \cite{SCADA_NBM_Review}, they are
treated as black box by the operators since they donâ€™t provide any insights regarding the root
cause of the failure. Incorporating SCADA log data2 to NBM could help tackle this problem by
providing some insights to an anomaly detected by the model in case a relevant warning or failure message was logged by the SCADA system around the same time.
It was also shown that incorporating SCADA logs containing information about operation
conditions or control events could help improve the accuracy of the model in case of events
unexplainable by the input signals \cite{Letzgus_Log}.//

Logs were "Never" treated as input feature in NBMs
